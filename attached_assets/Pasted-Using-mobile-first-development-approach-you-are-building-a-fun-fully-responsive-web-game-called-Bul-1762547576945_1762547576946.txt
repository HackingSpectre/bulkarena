Using mobile first development approach you are building a fun, fully responsive web game called BulkMind, inspired by BulkTrade (Bulk Exchange) — a decentralized perpetual futures exchange built on Solana, known for its unmatched on-chain speed, fairness, and transparency. BulkTrade’s goal is to merge the performance of centralized exchanges with the freedom of decentralized finance. Its tagline is “One Exchange, Infinite Markets.”

🔍 Research First

Before creating anything, study and understand the project deeply:

BulkTrade X handle: https://x.com/bulktrade

Official whitepaper: https://alphadocs.bulk.trade

Use this knowledge to form the question bank that powers all three game modes. The questions and puzzle content should reflect BulkTrade’s technology, ecosystem, and general crypto/trading knowledge.

🧠 Game Concept

BulkMind is a web game that combines learning, speed, and fun. It’s designed to make players feel like fast, sharp traders in the Bulk ecosystem — thinking, reacting, and competing.
It should be friendly, visually exciting, and deeply responsive on both desktop and mobile.

Players only need to enter their name once, and it should automatically save on their browser or device. When they return, they go straight to choosing a mode.

A welcome screen appears for first-time users where they type their name. Returning users skip this screen and can instantly play.

🎮 Game Modes
1. Word Puzzle

Players rearrange scrambled letters to form Bulk- and crypto-related words.
Each correct word advances them through levels, which become gradually harder.
This mode should feel energetic and slightly 3D — letters can move, rotate, or pop dynamically.

2. Trader Quiz

Multiple-choice questions about trading, Solana, and BulkTrade’s architecture.
Players progress through levels as they answer correctly.
This mode should feel like an interactive, high-speed quiz terminal.

3. Challenge Mode (60 Seconds)

A fast-paced lightning round where players have 60 seconds to answer as many Bulk-related questions as possible.
There are no levels here — just pure timed competition.
When the timer ends, their score is displayed alongside a global leaderboard showing other players’ top results.

Only the Challenge Mode has a leaderboard.

🧾 Game Rules & Data Behavior

A player’s name and device ID are saved locally on their browser.

The system remembers returning players automatically.

Players should also be saved in the database so their information persists across devices and appears in the leaderboard.

Scores should always update only when a player beats their previous high score.

Players can see other people’s scores on the global Challenge leaderboard, which should display each user’s name.

Word Puzzle and Trader Quiz have level systems; Challenge Mode does not.

🎨 Experience

BulkMind should feel like a fusion of a trading dashboard and an arcade game.
It should look and play beautifully on both phones and desktops.
The interface must be fast, clean, and immersive — using Phaser.js for interactivity and light 3D effects where necessary (especially for letter animations and transitions).

The tone should be friendly, confident, and exciting — like stepping into a futuristic trading arena.

The BulkTrade logo (attached) should be used tastefully where necessary — such as on the welcome screen, loading screens, or background branding.

⚙️ Core Principles

Use Next.js App Router for structure.

The experience should be modular, scalable, and highly responsive.

Store player names, modes, and scores in a database so that high scores and leaderboards persist.

Implement 3D elements tastefully where they enhance gameplay — for example, rotating letters, layered depth effects, and animated transitions.

Use server-side rendering (SSR) wherever possible for better SEO and performance.

Only use "use client" where it is truly necessary — the majority of components and pages should render server-side.

✨ Goal

Deliver a complete, playable, and engaging game that:

Welcomes first-time users with a name entry screen.

Remembers returning users automatically.

Saves players both locally and in the database.

Offers three distinct modes — Word Puzzle, Trader Quiz, and Challenge Mode.

Updates scores only when new highs are achieved.

Displays a live leaderboard for Challenge Mode using players’ names.

Uses the BulkTrade logo where suitable.

Feels immersive, fluid, and fun on all screen sizes.



in addition use tailwind version 3.4.1
